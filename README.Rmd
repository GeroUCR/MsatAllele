This repository contains my personal version of Filipe Alberto's R package `MsatAllele`. This version implements faster more efficient R code to allow the analysis of larger microsatellite data sets.

This package is intended for my own use, and I take no responsibility for any problems in the code. Users of the MsatAllele package should contact the orginal author of the package with any issues.
